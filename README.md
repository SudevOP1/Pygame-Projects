## Pygame Projects
These are some games that I created in Python using Pygame / Pygame-ce Library.

To run these:
1. Download the file
2. In command prompt run these two prompts:<br>
   `pip install pygame`<br>
   `pip install pygame-ce`<br>
4. Locate the game file with name `<game_name>.py`
5. In command prompt of directory with this file, run this prompt:<br>
   `python <game_name>.py`
