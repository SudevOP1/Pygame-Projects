## Pygame Projects

These are some of the games I coded in Python using pygame library.<br>
To play these games, follow the following steps:

1. Download the file
2. In command prompt run these two prompts:<br>
   `pip install pygame`<br>
   `pip install pygame`
4. Locate the game file with name `<game_name>.py`
5. In command prompt of directory with this file, run this prompt:<br>
   `python <game_name>.py`
